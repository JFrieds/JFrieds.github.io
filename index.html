Have you ever listened to a song and wondered, "I wish I could learn how to play that?" 

Did you take piano lessons when you were younger but never got to learn the songs 

you wanted to? Or maybe you are an accomplished musician and are just looking to 

learn a new style or genre.

That's how I felt. Years and years of classical lessons and I still felt unfulfilled. Why 

couldn't I be like my guitarist-friends and play along to the songs on the radio? Why I am 

playing Chopin when all I want to do is learn the new Green Day single?

As musicians, one of our biggest motivators is connecting with our listeners, be it our 

parents, friends, or an audience of thousands. Playing the music that speaks to us is 

what makes us play well and develop our skills. Remember the last time a song gave 

you chills? What if you could bring that experience to someone? After accomplishing it 

myself, I can tell you: it's incredible.

This is what I'm about at ________. Learn the music you want to learn, learn it well, and 

watch yourself improve. It's as simple as that. I am here as a resource for you, to keep 

you motivated, to provide resources, and to get you where you want to go.
